# Gallery and related components

## Design Pattern
1. ECS: entity-component-system
2. reuseable, compatible, versatile
3. function-wise: simple and independent

## Components:
1. object: content-holder, grid, portal
2. behavior: face-towards, follow, etc.
3. layout: layout-manager
4. event: event-manager

## Objectives:
1. explore feasible approaches to content browsing in VR
2. focus on logics not content
3. advantages of ECS on developing VR
4. proof of reuseability of components
